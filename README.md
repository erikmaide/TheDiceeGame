# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## My Goal

My objective of making this application is to introduce myself to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps I will build in the future. This app will teach myself how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I will create

IÂ´m going to make a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!
